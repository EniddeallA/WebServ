# WebServ

My version of the WebServ project at 42 school.
This project is about writing your own HTTP server.
You will be able to test it with an actual browser.
HTTP is one of the most used protocols on the internet.
Knowing its arcane will be useful, even if you wonâ€™t be working on a website.

This project has been successfully done with all mandatory tasks, with 0 Leaks.

Feel free to use it to undestand the project, never use it for cheating!
